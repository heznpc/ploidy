"""Convergence engine for Diploid debates.

Analyzes the debate transcript to determine:
- Points of agreement (both sessions converged independently)
- Points of productive disagreement (one session raised a valid concern)
- Points of irreducible disagreement (genuinely different values/priorities)

The convergence result is a structured synthesis, not a simple
majority vote. The goal is to surface *why* the sessions disagreed,
since context asymmetry makes disagreements interpretable.
